This burger site can take order entries, place them on an ordered list, and allow the user to mark the order as devoured if it was devoured! All entries are placed into a database for long term storage. MVC is utilized in creation of website and each piece can be updated easily without interfering with other parts of the site.

Devoured list is permanent as to request of client.
